# Changelog

What changes from one release to the next, in plain words. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). A tag `vX.Y.Z` creates the GitHub release, with the
Windows, Mac and Linux downloads attached; the release takes its notes from that version's section below.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The Sims 2 (DS) in one window, on the melonDS 1.1 core.
- AUTO layout: in town, the 3D world big with the touch screen's panel beside it; title, menus
  and Create-a-Sim side by side. Town is recognised from the game's status bar.
- FOCUS, SIDE and STACKED layouts by hand (0 to 3), Tab to swap the big screen.
- Mouse as the stylus, keyboard as the DS buttons, fast forward, save states, screenshots, and
  the game's own save beside the ROM.
- Downloads for Windows (one `.exe`), Mac (an app for Apple silicon and Intel) and Linux.
- Started without a ROM (a double click), it asks for one with the system's file picker and
  opens in the same folder next time.
- Looks, all off by default: sharper 3D (`--res3d N`, 2 to 4 times the DS's resolution), a
  widescreen 16:9 world (`--wide`) and 60 fps in-between frames for the 3D (`--interp`), ported
  from Pokémon FullDex's renderer.
- A headless mode to study the screens: input scripts, shots, save states, and pictures of the
  window's layout (`--compose`).
- The touch screen takes the window when the game plays on it: the timed social reactions
  (Impress and the like), the shop's catalogue and Build Rooms. The world comes back when they
  end.
- The DS microphone: by default a key blows into it (the vacuum's filter, the music mixer); the
  computer's own microphone, or none, as a setting (`--mic`).
- The DS clock is the computer's, also after loading a save state, and fast forward does not
  run it ahead of real time: the game's days, skill points and night missions keep to the
  clock, and it never goes back (the game punishes that). `--clock` fixes it for tests.
